# Product Specification Questions

## Missing Concepts Analysis

After reviewing the product specification document, the following areas could benefit from additional clarification and detail:

---

## Application Architecture & Technical Details

### Question 1: Database Strategy
What database technologies will be used for the Real API? (NoSQL, RDS, DynamoDB, etc.)

**Answer:**
The database technologies for the real API are relevant at this stage. The goal of the repo is to show an example of how to deploy a spa-based application. We don't need to actually have a working application. We just need a shell API with a dummy route and a UI that can call upon it using cloud-front behaviors.

---

### Question 2: API Design
What are the specific API endpoints and data models for the Real API?

**Answer:**
The goal is for the stage 0 deploy script to prompt for certain information such as the domain name or domain names that will be used for the deployed application. That will be captured and stored with the data in that stage folder.  So we don't need a set of domain names documented.

---

### Question 3: State Management
How will the React applications handle client-side state management? (Redux, Context API, Zustand, etc.)

**Answer:**
Again, this is out of scope for this repo. How we build the UI has nothing to do with the demonstration of the Mono repo.

---

### Question 4: Authentication & Authorization
What authentication mechanism will be implemented? (Cognito, Auth0, custom JWT, etc.)

**Answer:**
It's out of scope. However, the authentication method for the UI will be nothing specific to AWS.

---

### Question 5: Data Flow
How will data flow between the frontend and backend applications?

**Answer:**
Data flow between the front-ended and back-end will be via CloudFront behaviors. CloudFront will host the user interface application with a /api route as a CloudFront behavior pointing to the Lambda.

---

## Performance & Scalability

### Question 6: Load Testing
What are the expected traffic patterns and performance requirements?

**Answer:**
Load testing or monitoring or anything that were performance are completely out of the question or an out of scope for this repo. The repo is strictly a design example on how to deploy a spot application using a multi-stage approach with AWS bash and Terraform.

---

### Question 7: Caching Strategy
Will there be caching layers beyond CloudFront? (ElastiCache, application-level caching, etc.)

**Answer:**
Beyond the scope of this monorepo.

---

---

### Question 13: Data Encryption
What data encryption requirements exist beyond the basic AWS KMS mentioned?

**Answer:**

---

### Question 14: API Security
What API security measures will be implemented? (Rate limiting, WAF, API keys, etc.)

**Answer:**
This is out of scope.

---

### Question 15: Network Security
Will there be VPC configurations, security groups, and NACLs beyond basic setup?

**Answer:**
This is out of scope.

---

## Operational Concerns

### Question 16: Backup Strategy
What backup and disaster recovery procedures are needed?

**Answer:**
This is out of scope.

---

### Question 17: Logging Requirements
What specific logging requirements exist beyond basic CloudWatch?

**Answer:**
No logging is required beyond CloudWatch at this point.

---

### Question 18: Error Handling
How should application errors be handled and reported?

**Answer:**
This is out of scope.

---

### Question 19: Health Checks
What health check endpoints and monitoring are required?

**Answer:**
The API should respond to a get or post at the root of the API for a ping request by replying with a single message and date timestamp.

---

### Question 20: Maintenance Windows
Are there specific maintenance window requirements?

**Answer:**
This is out of scope.

---

## Development & Deployment

### Question 21: Code Quality
Will there be code quality tools and standards? (ESLint, Prettier, SonarQube, etc.)

**Answer:**
This is out of scope.

---

### Question 22: Testing Strategy
What testing approaches will be used? (Unit, integration, e2e, load testing, etc.)

**Answer:**
As far as testing the application, that is out of scope for this effort. However, as we create the scripts to deploy the example applications, the scripts we create will need to obviously verify that each step inside of their execution are successful.

---

### Question 23: Feature Flags
Will feature flagging be implemented for gradual rollouts?

**Answer:**
We will never use feature flags ever.

---

### Question 24: Blue-Green Deployments
Are blue-green or canary deployment strategies needed?

**Answer:**
This is out of scope.

---

### Question 25: Rollback Procedures
What rollback procedures should be available?

**Answer:**
This is already documented in the product specifications document. However, each script should be able to be run multiple times safely. And each step within the script should check to see whether or not that script, that step is necessary before executing. This will allow us to correct any issue that might cause a script to fail and then simply rerun the script.
