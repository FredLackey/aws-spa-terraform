### Notes

- This stage uses pure AWS CLI and bash scripting with no Terraform components
- All scripts must implement idempotent operations with "validate-before-create" principle
- AWS SSO authentication validation is required before any operations
- All resources must be tagged with Project and Environment mandatory tags
